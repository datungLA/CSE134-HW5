# CSE134HW2
## March 16 2025, HW 5 Update:
Enhancements and Improvements\
For this update, I refined the Projects section by restructuring the layout using a responsive grid system and ensuring project cards have a consistent size. I also added scrollable overflow to prevent distortion when adding new projects. Additionally, I improved theme toggling and form validation logic in JavaScript for better UX. Minor CSS refinements were made to improve readability and responsiveness across devices. These changes enhance usability, maintainability, and visual consistency while keeping the site scalable for future updates.
